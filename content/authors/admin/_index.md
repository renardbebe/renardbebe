Hello, this is Meng, a data security engineer. I received a bachelor's degree in engineering from Sun Yat-sen University in 2019 and a master's degree in engineering from Tsinghua University in 2022. I am under the tutelage of Associate Professor. Yu Jiang, and my research direction is blockchain security and fuzz testing. I have won the National Scholarship for three times and won the Outstanding Graduate Award. 

Currently, I am engaged in data security and data governance at Tencent Security Yunding Lab, responsible for Data Security Governance Center, API security products. Anyone interested is welcome to communicate with me.
