I am Miss. Meng, a fresh nymphean programmer. I graduated from Sun Yat-sen University in 2019 and am currently studying at the School of Software, Tsinghua University. I am under the tutelage of Associate Professor. Yu Jiang, and my research direction is blockchain security. I have won the National Scholarship for three times and won the Outstanding Graduate Award. 

In the future, I will work at Tencent Security group and engage in data security research and development.
