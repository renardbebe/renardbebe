abstract = "With the increasing popularity of block-chain technologies, more and more engineers use smart contracts for application implementation. Traditional supporting tools can either provide code completions based on static libraries or detect a limited set of vulnerabilities, which results in the manpower waste during coding and miss-detection of bugs. In this work, we propose SCStudio, a unified smart contract development platform, which aims to help developers implement more secure smart contracts easily. The core idea is to realize real-time security-reinforced recommendation through pattern-based learning; and to perform security-oriented validation via integrated testing. SCStudio was implemented as a plug-in of VS Code. It has been used as the official development tool of WeBank and integrated as the recommended development tool by FISCO-BCOS community. In practice, it outperforms existing contract development environments, such as Remix, improving the average word suggestion accuracy by 30%-60% and helping detect about 25% more vulnerabilities.
